# Clustering and PCA

We perform clustering and PCA using the ForestFires dataset, located in the UCI repository.

We use the following clustering algorithms:

- KMeans
- Agglomerative
- Spectral

The goal is to find the optimal number of clusters, the number of principal components, and analyze which clustering algorithm is most effective using the different scalars.

Comments and notes are provided on the Jupyter Notebook.
